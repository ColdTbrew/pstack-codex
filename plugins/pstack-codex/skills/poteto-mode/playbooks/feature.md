### Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate implementation; stay in the lead.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for parallel design exploration. Skipping stays as `architect skipped: <reason>`; do not fold the design decision silently into implementation.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four todo items. A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before fan-out.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers parallelize. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one worker is best, name why.
4. Delegate code-writing to `pstack_builder_luna` for precise work or `pstack_builder_sol` for demanding work. Give it a specific scope: file paths, the named data shape and its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain**, and success criteria. Review its diff yourself. When implementation admits multiple valid shapes, use the **arena** skill so candidates surface alternatives and the cross-judge guards the pick. If nested spawning is unavailable, the current agent owns the diff directly; never return a standing-by response. Comments per **Comments**. Re-ground against source for upstream-derived files, port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers, and verify each.
5. Verify on the matching surface. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass; flag it.
6. Rebase into small, ordered commits; stack follow-ups.
   Use the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, building, verifying, and committing each small unit before the next.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. Run **Opening a PR**.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline; that owner fans out internally after the blocking phase. Parent-level fan-out is for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries; spawn a fresh owner rather than chaining interrupts.

**Reply:** what you built, what you chose and why, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.
